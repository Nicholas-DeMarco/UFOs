# UFOs

The purpose of this analysis was to use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO data that is stored as a Javascript array. The table has the ability to filter data based on certain criteria.

The outcome of the webpage turned out to be easily usable in my opinion. Our filter table makes it very easy to navigate through certain criteria as they wish such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

As you use the filters to find specific dates and states for example, you do not need to worry about submitting and refreshing your results, as it will automatically update for you each time you click enter. Clearing out all of the filter boxes and pressing Enter again will bring you back to the original page layout. Below is an example of using the filters to find UFO sightings on the date 1/4/2010 in the US.

One drawback of this design is that the filter method is case sensitive. If you enter any items in upper case, the search results will return with a blank. For example, if you input "US" for country instead of "us", the city will not return the filtered data. One of my recommendations for further development would be to remove case-sensitivity in all of the textbox fields.
